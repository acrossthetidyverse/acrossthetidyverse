```{r include = FALSE}
library(svglite)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo    = TRUE,
    warning = FALSE,
    error   = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    device  = 'svg',
    fig.width = 6,
    fig.align = 'center',
    fig.height = 6,
    dpi = 300)
```


So this is a test, to see what other plots and stuff look like.

Let's give naniar a spin, shall we?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(visdat)
library(naniar)

```

How does visdat look?

```{r}

vis_miss(airquality)
vis_dat(airquality)
```


And then what about some missing data plots?

```{r}

ggplot(data = airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Temp)) + 
  geom_missing_point()

```

How about tables? How do they look?

```{r}

miss_var_summary(airquality) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```


And then, for fun, let's try out `treezy`

```{r}

library(treezy)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)


airquality %>%
  add_prop_miss() %>%
  rpart(prop_miss ~ ., data = .) %>%
  importance_plot()
  

```

And does it deal with mathematical notation?

$$
y \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \epsilon
$$

What about interactive graphics?

```{r}

library(plotly)

ggplotly(vis_dat(airquality))



```


```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(maxcovr)

york_crime %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers()


```
